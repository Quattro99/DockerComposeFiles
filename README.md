- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Make sure both Docker and Docker Compose are running correctly on your machine.

## Getting Started

1\. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Quattro99/DockerComposeFiles.git

   cd DockerComposeFiles
   ```


2\. **Navigate to the Desired Service**:

   Change into the directory of the service you are interested in. For example:

   ```
   cd example-service
   ```

3\. **Start the Docker Containers**:

   Use Docker Compose to start the service:

   ```
   docker-compose up

   ```

   To run it in detached mode (in the background), append the `-d` flag:

   ```bash

   docker-compose up -d

   ```

4\. **Stop the Docker Containers**:

   To stop the running containers, use:

   ```

   docker-compose down

   ```

## Usage

Each Docker Compose file is designed for specific applications and may have different configurations. Refer to the `README.md` file located within each service directory for detailed usage instructions and configuration options.
